# AI-ML-Lab Project
#### On Twitter, it is the fact that many active scientists discuss and share their experiences or their evalutations of a reagent. 
#### Those kinds of information are extremely usesful for other researchers who are willing to optimize their experient conditions,
#### in terms of the importance and the unacceptable cost of experiental reagents.
* The ideas are:
<ol>
<li> Use sentiment140 data set that contains tweets with sentiment categorized in positive or negative bins to train a classifier.</li>
<li> Use twitter api to create queries of a interested brand.</li>
<li> Use the classifier from (1) to understand the sentiment from the tweets from (2), which shows % of positive and negative evalutation.</li>
<li> Deploy the classifier on Django</li>
</ol>
* File structure
